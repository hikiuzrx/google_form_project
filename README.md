# Google form challenge 
it's a challenge from an online backend developpmenet hackathon hollow dev which presented by Micro club it was mainly backend focused but I wanted to recreate it as a full stack application 
technologies used in this application starting with :
THE FRONT END :
the front end is developped using Next js + typescript for server side rendering and app router 
the front end is kind of a mess because this project wasn't front end oriented so I didn't really focus on this aspect but I might give it more attention later ;
THE BACK END: 
it was developped using Node Express js + Typescript + Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL data base 
the authentication system in this application was a mix of simple credentials authentication handled by the server and google authentication handled by NEXT AUTH package the project is lil messy and still on progress
